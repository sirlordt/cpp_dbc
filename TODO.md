## Pending Tasks

- NEW FEATURE: Add more examples.
- NEW FEATURE: Add more debug messages?
- PLANNED: Start to using in real proyect and test how ease is integrate in third party project. Maybe write a INTERGRATION.md to explain how full integrate in a real project.
- PLANNED: More db drivers
   - Firebird/Interbase
   - SQLServer/SysBase?

   - DB2?
   - Clickhouse?
   - Cassandra/Symtilla?
   - Mongo? crazy bro is not sql db!!!

## Completed Tasks

- Added optional thread-safe database driver operations:
  - Added DB_DRIVER_THREAD_SAFE CMake option (default: ON)
  - Added --db-driver-thread-safe-off option to all build scripts
  - Added mutex protection to MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite drivers
  - Added comprehensive thread-safety stress tests for all drivers
  - Tests include: concurrent connections, connection pool access, stress tests
- Migrated all database drivers from raw pointers to smart pointers:
  - MySQL: Added MySQLResDeleter, MySQLStmtDeleter, MySQLDeleter custom deleters
  - MySQL: Changed m_mysql to shared_ptr, m_stmt to unique_ptr, m_result to unique_ptr
  - MySQL: PreparedStatement uses weak_ptr for safe connection reference
  - PostgreSQL: Added PGresultDeleter, PGconnDeleter custom deleters
  - PostgreSQL: Changed m_conn to shared_ptr, m_result to unique_ptr
  - PostgreSQL: PreparedStatement uses weak_ptr for safe connection reference
  - SQLite: Added SQLiteStmtDeleter, SQLiteDbDeleter custom deleters
  - SQLite: Changed m_db to shared_ptr, m_stmt to unique_ptr
  - SQLite: PreparedStatement uses weak_ptr for safe connection reference
  - SQLite: Changed m_activeStatements from set<shared_ptr> to set<weak_ptr>
  - Benefits: RAII cleanup, exception safety, clear ownership semantics
- Add to benchmark the feature to create a base line to  CPU_RAM_PLATFORM_OS. AMD_Ryzen_9_9950X_16-Core_Processor_16GB_Ubuntu_24_04 an compare with the last match in base line  
- Migrated benchmark system from Catch2 to Google Benchmark:
  - Updated CMakeLists.txt to use Google Benchmark instead of Catch2WithMain
  - Added benchmark/1.8.3 as a dependency in conanfile.txt
  - Rewrote all benchmark files to use Google Benchmark API
  - Improved benchmark table initialization system with table reuse
  - Added support for multiple iterations and benchmark repetitions
  - Added new configuration parameters (--min-time and --repetitions)
  - Added mysql-off option to disable MySQL benchmarks
- Added mtehots begiTransaction() to replace setAutoCommit funcionality
- Reseearch Why sqlite driver is showing warning messages
- Add the feature to messages warning folling the DEBUG_SQLITE flag
- NEW FEATURE: Add benchmarks to 10 100 1000 10000 rows in Insert/Delete/Update/Select Operations
  - Implemented in benchmark directory with files for all database drivers
  - Added benchmark_main.cpp with common benchmark setup
  - Added benchmark files for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite operations
  - Added support for different data sizes (10, 100, 1000, and 10000 rows)
  - Added `--benchmarks` option to build.sh and `--run-benchmarks` option to helper.sh
- Activate ALL possible warnings and compile time checks
  - Implemented in build_cpp_dbc.sh and build_test_cpp_dbc.sh with flags -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wconversion -Wshadow -Wcast-qual -Wformat=2 -Wunused -Werror=return-type -Werror=switch -Wdouble-promotion -Wfloat-equal -Wundef -Wpointer-arith -Wcast-align
  - Added definitions for backward.hpp to silence -Wundef warnings
  - Refactored code to use m_ prefix for member variables to avoid -Wshadow
  - Fixed implicit conversions to avoid -Wconversion
  - Improved exception handling to avoid variable shadowing
- Add rpm support using docker fedora 42 and 43
- Add --run-build-lib-dist-deb using docker (implemented as build_dist_pkg.sh)
- Add library dw to linker en CPP_SBC
- Finish to add the license header to .cpp files
- BUG: When no pass the --auto the script is not stop before continue
- NEW FEATURE: Capture the output when the run test to .log file in the helper.sh
- NEW FEATURE: Capture the param --check-test-log in the helper.sh
- NEW FEATURE: Add specific testing of json field types.
- NEW FEATURE: Create a generic function fo capture the callstack java like
- NEW FEATURE: Extend DBException to make more robust add Mark and not concatenated to message
- NEW FEATURE: Extend DBException to make more robust add Call stack where throw the exception

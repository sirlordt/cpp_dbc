## Completed Tasks

- PostgreSQL Exception-Free API Implementation:

  - Replaced "NOT_IMPLEMENTED" placeholder implementations with full functional code
  - Added error handling with unique error codes for each error condition
  - Implemented for connection operations, transaction management, and statement execution
  - Ensures consistent API pattern across all database drivers

  - Upsert support for update operations
  - Thread-safe operations (conditionally compiled with DB_DRIVER_THREAD_SAFE)
  - Added comprehensive test suite: test_mongodb_common.hpp/cpp, test_mongodb_real.cpp
  - Added MongoDB configuration to test_db_connections.yml

  - Moved driver files from `drivers/` to `drivers/relational/`
  - Created placeholder directories for future database types: columnar, document, graph, kv, timeseries
  - Updated all include paths in source files, tests, benchmarks, and examples
  - Updated CMakeLists.txt with new source file paths
- Connection pool memory safety improvements with smart pointers:
  - Added m_poolAlive shared atomic flag to track pool lifetime
  - RelationalDBPooledConnection now uses weak_ptr for pool reference
  - Added isPoolValid() helper method to check if pool is still alive
  - Pool sets m_poolAlive to false in close() before cleanup
  - Prevents use-after-free when pool is destroyed while connections are in use
- API naming convention refactoring:
  - Renamed driver classes: MySQLDriver → MySQLDBDriver, PostgreSQLDriver → PostgreSQLDBDriver, SQLiteDriver → SQLiteDBDriver, FirebirdDriver → FirebirdDBDriver
  - Renamed connection class: Connection → RelationalDBConnection
  - Renamed config class: ConnectionPoolConfig → DBConnectionPoolConfig
  - Renamed DriverManager method: getConnection() → getDBConnection()
  - Renamed TransactionManager method: getTransactionConnection() → getTransactionDBConnection()
  - Renamed Driver method: connect() → connectRelational()
  - Updated all benchmarks, tests, and examples to use new naming convention
- BLOB memory safety improvements with smart pointers:
  - Migrated all BLOB implementations from raw pointers to weak_ptr for safe connection references
  - FirebirdBlob: Uses weak_ptr<FirebirdConnection> with getConnection() helper
  - MySQLBlob: Uses weak_ptr<MYSQL> with getMySQLConnection() helper
  - PostgreSQLBlob: Uses weak_ptr<PGconn> with getPGConnection() helper
  - SQLiteBlob: Uses weak_ptr<sqlite3> with getSQLiteConnection() helper
  - Added isConnectionValid() method to all BLOB classes
  - Operations throw DBException if connection has been closed (prevents use-after-free)
- Firebird driver database creation and improved error handling:
  - Added `createDatabase()` method to FirebirdDriver for creating new databases
  - Added `command()` method for driver-specific commands
  - Fixed critical bug in error message capture (now saves error BEFORE cleanup)
  - Improved `interpretStatusVector()` with SQLCODE interpretation
  - Added `firebird_reserved_word_example.cpp` example
- Firebird/Interbase driver with comprehensive test coverage and benchmarks:
  - Full driver implementation with BLOB, transaction, and connection pool support
  - Added benchmark suite (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations)
  - Added thread-safety tests, JOIN tests, JSON tests, and transaction isolation tests
- Added optional thread-safe database driver operations:
  - Added DB_DRIVER_THREAD_SAFE CMake option (default: ON)
  - Added --db-driver-thread-safe-off option to all build scripts
  - Added mutex protection to MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite drivers
  - Added comprehensive thread-safety stress tests for all drivers
  - Tests include: concurrent connections, connection pool access, stress tests
- Migrated all database drivers from raw pointers to smart pointers:
  - MySQL: Added MySQLResDeleter, MySQLStmtDeleter, MySQLDeleter custom deleters
  - MySQL: Changed m_mysql to shared_ptr, m_stmt to unique_ptr, m_result to unique_ptr
  - MySQL: PreparedStatement uses weak_ptr for safe connection reference
  - PostgreSQL: Added PGresultDeleter, PGconnDeleter custom deleters
  - PostgreSQL: Changed m_conn to shared_ptr, m_result to unique_ptr
  - PostgreSQL: PreparedStatement uses weak_ptr for safe connection reference
  - SQLite: Added SQLiteStmtDeleter, SQLiteDbDeleter custom deleters
  - SQLite: Changed m_db to shared_ptr, m_stmt to unique_ptr
  - SQLite: PreparedStatement uses weak_ptr for safe connection reference
  - SQLite: Changed m_activeStatements from set<shared_ptr> to set<weak_ptr>
  - Benefits: RAII cleanup, exception safety, clear ownership semantics
- Add to benchmark the feature to create a base line to  CPU_RAM_PLATFORM_OS. AMD_Ryzen_9_9950X_16-Core_Processor_16GB_Ubuntu_24_04 an compare with the last match in base line

  - Added definitions for backward.hpp to silence -Wundef warnings
  - Refactored code to use m_ prefix for member variables to avoid -Wshadow
  - Fixed implicit conversions to avoid -Wconversion
  - Improved exception handling to avoid variable shadowing

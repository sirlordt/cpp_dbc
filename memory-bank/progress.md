## Known Issues

### Fixed Issues
1. **Database Configuration Integration**:
   - Added integration between database configuration and connection classes
   - Created new `config_integration_example.cpp` with examples of different connection methods
   - Added `createConnection()` method to `DatabaseConfig` class
   - Added `createConnection()` and `createConnectionPool()` methods to `DatabaseConfigManager`
   - Added new methods to `DriverManager` to work with configuration classes
   - Added script to run the configuration integration example
   - Changed URL format from "cppdbc:" to "cpp_dbc:" for consistency
   - Updated all examples, tests, and code to use the new format

2. **Connection Pool Enhancements**:
   - Moved `ConnectionPoolConfig` from connection_pool.hpp to config/database_config.hpp
   - Enhanced `ConnectionPoolConfig` with more options and better encapsulation
   - Added new constructors and factory methods to `ConnectionPool`
   - Added integration between connection pool and database configuration
   - Improved code organization with forward declarations
   - Added database_config.cpp implementation file

3. **YAML Configuration Support**:
   - Added optional YAML configuration support to the library
   - Created database configuration classes in `include/cpp_dbc/config/database_config.hpp`
   - Implemented YAML configuration loader in `include/cpp_dbc/config/yaml_config_loader.hpp` and `src/config/yaml_config_loader.cpp`
   - Added `--yaml` option to `build.sh` and `build_cpp_dbc.sh` to enable YAML support
   - Modified CMakeLists.txt to conditionally include YAML-related files based on USE_CPP_YAML flag
   - Fixed issue with Conan generators directory path in `build_cpp_dbc.sh`

2. **Examples Improvements**:
   - Added `--examples` option to `build.sh` and `build_cpp_dbc.sh` to build examples
   - Created YAML configuration example in `examples/config_example.cpp`
   - Added example YAML configuration file in `examples/example_config.yml`
   - Created script to run the configuration example in `examples/run_config_example.sh`
   - Fixed initialization issue in `examples/transaction_manager_example.cpp`

3. **Project Structure Reorganization**:
   - Moved all content from `src/libs/cpp_dbc/` to `libs/cpp_dbc/` in the root of the project.
   - Reorganized the internal structure of the library with separate `src/` and `include/cpp_dbc/` directories.
   - Updated all CMake files and include paths to reflect the new directory structure.
   - This provides a cleaner, more standard library organization that follows C++ best practices.

2. **Build Configuration**:
   - Changed the default build type from Release to Debug to facilitate development and debugging.
   - Added support for `--release` argument to build in Release mode when needed.
   - Fixed issues with finding the correct `conan_toolchain.cmake` file based on build type.
   - Ensured both the library and the main project use the same build type.

3. **VS Code Debugging Issues**:
   - Added the correct include path for nlohmann_json library.
   - Updated the `c_cpp_properties.json` file to include the necessary paths.
   - Modified CMakeLists.txt to add explicit include directories.
   - Configured VSCode to use CMakeTools for better integration:
     - Updated settings.json to use direct configuration (without presets)
     - Added Debug and Release configurations
     - Configured proper include paths for IntelliSense
     - Added CMake-based debugging configuration with direct path to executable
     - Fixed tasks.json to support CMake builds
   - Identified and documented IntelliSense issue with preprocessor definitions:
     - IntelliSense may show `USE_POSTGRESQL` as 0 even after compilation has activated it
     - Solution: After compilation, use CTRL+SHIFT+P and select "Developer: Reload Window"
     - This forces IntelliSense to reload with the updated preprocessor definitions
   - These changes ensure that VS Code can find all header files and properly debug the application.

4. **Installation Directory**:
   - Modified the installation path to use `/home/dsystems/Desktop/projects/cpp/cpp_dbc/build/libs/cpp_dbc` for consistency.
   - Updated the main CMakeLists.txt to look for the library in the new location.

5. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Implemented basic unit tests using Catch2
   - Created test directory structure in `libs/cpp_dbc/test`
   - Added build scripts for tests with ASAN and Valgrind support
   - Documented ASAN issues in `memory-bank/asan_issues.md`
   - Added `--test` option to `build.sh` to enable building tests
   - Created `run_test.sh` script in the root directory to run tests
   - Modified `build_cpp_dbc.sh` to accept the `--test` option
   - Changed default value of `CPP_DBC_BUILD_TESTS` to `OFF` in CMakeLists.txt
   - Fixed path issues in `run_test_cpp_dbc.sh`
   - Added `yaml-cpp` dependency to `libs/cpp_dbc/conanfile.txt` for tests
   - Added automatic project build detection in `run_test.sh`

   - Added `--ldd-bin` option to check executable dependencies locally
   - Added `--run-bin` option to run the executable
   - Improved error handling and reporting
   - Added support for getting executable name from `.dist_build`

7. **Improved Docker Container Build**:
   - Enhanced `build.dist.sh` to accept the same parameters as `build.sh`
   - Implemented automatic detection of shared library dependencies
   - Added mapping of libraries to their corresponding Debian packages
   - Ensured correct package names for special cases (e.g., libsasl2-2)
   - Improved Docker container creation with only necessary dependencies
   - Fixed numbering of build steps for better readability

7. **Previous Fixed Issues**:
   - Fixed PostgreSQL header propagation issues.

### Potential Areas of Concern
Based on the code structure, potential areas of concern might include:

1. **Resource Management**:
   - Ensuring proper cleanup of database resources in all error scenarios
   - Handling connection failures gracefully

2. **Thread Safety**:
   - Potential race conditions in complex multi-threaded scenarios
   - Deadlock prevention in transaction management

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Consistent error reporting across different database implementations
   - Proper propagation of database-specific errors

4. **Performance**:
   - Connection pool tuning for different workloads
   - Optimization of prepared statement handling

5. **AddressSanitizer Issues**:
   - Random crashes during compilation with ASAN enabled
   - See `memory-bank/asan_issues.md` for detailed information and workarounds
   - Consider using Valgrind as an alternative for memory checking

## Evolution of Project Decisions

The project shows evidence of several key architectural decisions:

1. **JDBC-Inspired API**:
   - The decision to follow JDBC patterns provides familiarity for developers with Java experience
   - This approach enables a clean separation between interface and implementation

2. **Driver Architecture**:
   - The driver-based approach allows for easy extension to support additional databases
   - The `DriverManager` pattern simplifies client code

3. **Connection Pooling**:
   - The implementation of a dedicated connection pool addresses performance concerns
   - The configurable nature allows adaptation to different usage patterns

4. **Transaction Management**:
   - The separate transaction manager component addresses the complexity of distributed transactions
   - The design supports cross-thread transaction coordination

5. **Smart Pointer Usage**:
   - The use of `std::shared_ptr` simplifies resource management
   - This approach reduces the risk of resource leaks

6. **Configuration Management**:
   - The decision to implement a configuration system allows for centralized database settings
   - The YAML support is optional to avoid unnecessary dependencies
   - The configuration classes are designed to be extensible for other formats
   - This approach provides flexibility in how database connections are configured

These decisions reflect a focus on:
- Clean architecture
- Extensibility
- Performance
- Resource safety
- Developer ergonomics

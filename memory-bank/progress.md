# CPP_DBC Project Progress

## Current Status

The CPP_DBC library appears to be in a functional state with the following components implemented:

1. **Core Interfaces**: All core interfaces (`Connection`, `PreparedStatement`, `ResultSet`, `Driver`) are defined
2. **MySQL Implementation**: Complete implementation of MySQL driver
3. **PostgreSQL Implementation**: Complete implementation of PostgreSQL driver
4. **Connection Pool**: Fully implemented with configuration options

## What's Left to Build

Based on the current state of the project, potential areas for enhancement include:

1. **Additional Database Support**:
   - Oracle Database driver
   - SQLite driver
   - Microsoft SQL Server driver

2. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Batch statement execution
   - Stored procedure support
   - Metadata retrieval (table information, etc.)
   - Connection event listeners
   - Statement caching

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Statement caching
   - Result set streaming for large datasets
   - Connection validation optimization

4. **Documentation and Examples**:
   - More comprehensive documentation
   - Additional example applications
   - Performance benchmarks

5. **Testing**:
   - Comprehensive unit tests
   - Integration tests with actual databases
   - Performance tests

## Known Issues

### Fixed Issues
1. **Project Structure Reorganization**:
   - Moved all content from `src/libs/cpp_dbc/` to `libs/cpp_dbc/` in the root of the project.
   - Reorganized the internal structure of the library with separate `src/` and `include/cpp_dbc/` directories.
   - Updated all CMake files and include paths to reflect the new directory structure.
   - This provides a cleaner, more standard library organization that follows C++ best practices.

2. **Build Configuration**:
   - Changed the default build type from Release to Debug to facilitate development and debugging.
   - Added support for `--release` argument to build in Release mode when needed.
   - Fixed issues with finding the correct `conan_toolchain.cmake` file based on build type.
   - Ensured both the library and the main project use the same build type.

3. **VS Code Debugging Issues**:
   - Added the correct include path for nlohmann_json library.
   - Updated the `c_cpp_properties.json` file to include the necessary paths.
   - Modified CMakeLists.txt to add explicit include directories.
   - Configured VSCode to use CMakeTools for better integration:
     - Updated settings.json to use direct configuration (without presets)
     - Added Debug and Release configurations
     - Configured proper include paths for IntelliSense
     - Added CMake-based debugging configuration with direct path to executable
     - Fixed tasks.json to support CMake builds
   - Identified and documented IntelliSense issue with preprocessor definitions:
     - IntelliSense may show `USE_POSTGRESQL` as 0 even after compilation has activated it
     - Solution: After compilation, use CTRL+SHIFT+P and select "Developer: Reload Window"
     - This forces IntelliSense to reload with the updated preprocessor definitions
   - These changes ensure that VS Code can find all header files and properly debug the application.

4. **Installation Directory**:
   - Modified the installation path to use `/home/dsystems/Desktop/projects/cpp/cpp_dbc/build/libs/cpp_dbc` for consistency.
   - Updated the main CMakeLists.txt to look for the library in the new location.

5. **Previous Fixed Issues**:
   - Fixed PostgreSQL header propagation issues.
   - Fixed naming conflicts with executable names.
   - Suppressed CMake warnings with `-Wno-dev` flag.
   - Fixed environment variable issues for database driver status.
   - Fixed MySQL-only dependencies by separating the DriverManager implementation.
   - Updated C++ standard to C++23.

### Potential Areas of Concern
Based on the code structure, potential areas of concern might include:

1. **Resource Management**:
   - Ensuring proper cleanup of database resources in all error scenarios
   - Handling connection failures gracefully

2. **Thread Safety**:
   - Potential race conditions in complex multi-threaded scenarios
   - Deadlock prevention in transaction management

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Consistent error reporting across different database implementations
   - Proper propagation of database-specific errors

4. **Performance**:
   - Connection pool tuning for different workloads
   - Optimization of prepared statement handling

## Evolution of Project Decisions

The project shows evidence of several key architectural decisions:

1. **JDBC-Inspired API**:
   - The decision to follow JDBC patterns provides familiarity for developers with Java experience
   - This approach enables a clean separation between interface and implementation

2. **Driver Architecture**:
   - The driver-based approach allows for easy extension to support additional databases
   - The `DriverManager` pattern simplifies client code

3. **Connection Pooling**:
   - The implementation of a dedicated connection pool addresses performance concerns
   - The configurable nature allows adaptation to different usage patterns

4. **Transaction Management**:
   - The separate transaction manager component addresses the complexity of distributed transactions
   - The design supports cross-thread transaction coordination

5. **Smart Pointer Usage**:
   - The use of `std::shared_ptr` simplifies resource management
   - This approach reduces the risk of resource leaks

These decisions reflect a focus on:
- Clean architecture
- Extensibility
- Performance
- Resource safety
- Developer ergonomics

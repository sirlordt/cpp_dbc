# CPP_DBC Product Context

## Purpose and Problem Statement

The CPP_DBC library addresses a common challenge in C++ database programming: the lack of a standardized, unified API for database operations across different database systems. Unlike Java, which has JDBC as a standard database connectivity API, C++ developers often need to work directly with database-specific client libraries, leading to:

1. **Code duplication** when supporting multiple database systems
2. **Tight coupling** between application code and specific database implementations
3. **Inconsistent error handling** across different database libraries
4. **Manual connection management** that can lead to resource leaks
5. **Complex transaction handling**, especially in multi-threaded environments

## Solution

CPP_DBC solves these problems by providing:

1. **Unified API**: A consistent interface for database operations regardless of the underlying database system
2. **Driver Architecture**: Database-specific implementations encapsulated behind common interfaces
3. **Connection Pooling**: Efficient management of database connections to improve performance
4. **Transaction Management**: Simplified transaction handling across threads
5. **Prepared Statements**: Support for parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

## Target Users

- C++ developers working with relational databases
- Applications that need to support multiple database systems
- Systems requiring efficient connection management
- Multi-threaded applications with complex transaction requirements

## Use Cases

1. **Cross-Database Applications**: Systems that need to work with both MySQL and PostgreSQL
2. **High-Performance Applications**: Applications that benefit from connection pooling
3. **Distributed Systems**: Applications with complex transaction requirements across multiple components
4. **Security-Critical Applications**: Systems that need protection against SQL injection through prepared statements

## Comparison with Alternatives

Unlike other C++ database libraries, CPP_DBC:

1. **Focuses on JDBC-like API**: Familiar to developers with Java background
2. **Provides Built-in Connection Pooling**: Many libraries require separate connection pool implementations
3. **Includes Transaction Management**: Simplifies complex transaction scenarios
4. **Maintains Lightweight Design**: Minimal dependencies beyond the database client libraries

## Design Philosophy

CPP_DBC follows these key principles:

1. **Abstraction**: Hide database-specific details behind common interfaces
2. **Resource Management**: Automatic handling of database resources to prevent leaks
3. **Thread Safety**: Support for concurrent database operations
4. **Configurability**: Flexible configuration options for connection pools and transactions
5. **Simplicity**: Straightforward API that follows familiar patterns
